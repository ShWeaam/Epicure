# Epicure
  My Full Stack bootcamp project - building a food orders website using MERN stack<br />
  Responsive web application for orders from top restaurants in Tel Aviv.<br /> 
  The application is based on a real product and includes standard features relevant for the industry.<br />
  the code is deployed on heroku<br />
  https://epicure-app.herokuapp.com/ <br />
